# Esquisse Shiny
### Project 1 - A Shiny App that utilizes public API data and allows users to control visualization using the esquisse package in R. 

## Description
#### Motivation for this project came from recent Shiny Apps that I created. In the past, working with Shiny, I've always seen examples using R data, which is great for learning, but not as great translated into real world practice. My original work around was having a user upload a CSV file and using that data, and while useful in some circumstances depending on data literacy of the user, I still found this wasn't ideal. Wanting to learn more about API use and creation, I decided a shiny app was the perfect place to start. 

#### Beyond wanting to delve into APIs in Shiny, I also wanted to create an App that would give users the power to control their own visualizations. Hoping to leverage the power of data visualization with the knowlegde of industry experts to create a straight forward way for users to explore their data.
